# SIS #03 — Report: Smart Campus Room Availability Checker

     ### sub-heading, and the **Label:** words — the checker finds your answers by them.
     Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". Delete these <!-- --> comments if you like. -->

## 2. Baseline — before any new AI exchange

### 2.1 Scope in my own words

**Scope:** The page checks if one selected room is free for a time interval on one day and shows "Available" or "Unavailable" with reasons. It only checks and does not create a booking. There is no login, no database and no saving.

### 2.2 The acceptance criteria in my own words

| AC | In my own words |
| --- | --- |
| AC1 | Start and end must be between 0 and 1440 minutes, start must be less than end, and start must be strictly after now (start = now is rejected). |
| AC2 | The maximum length is 120 minutes. Exactly 120 is allowed, 121 is rejected. |
| AC3 | If the room is blocked, the answer is always False, even if the time is free. |
| AC4 | Two bookings conflict when they share any minute (start < e_end and end > e_start). If one ends at 11:00 and the other starts at 11:00, that is allowed and is not a conflict. |
| AC5 | The function only returns True or False and never changes the existing list. |
| AC6 | On error the user sees a clear red message with the reason. On a phone everything is in one column and there is no side scrolling. |


### 2.3 Likely failure points

| # | Failure point | AC | How I will check it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Touching ends: using <= instead of < makes 12:00–13:00 conflict with 11:00–12:00. | AC4 | T1 |
| 2 | Start exactly at now: the code checks start < now instead of start <= now to reject, so a booking that starts exactly at now wrongly passes. | AC1 | T6 |

### 2.4 The contract

| Parameter | Meaning | Type and allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | The start of the requested booking, minutes from midnight (9:30 = 570) | whole number, 0 to 1440 |
| `end` | The end of the requested booking; the end minute is not included | whole number, 0 to 1440 |
| `now` | The current time, as a number of minutes from midnight | whole number, 0 to 1439 |
| `blocked` | True means the room cannot be booked at any time | boolean |
| `existing` | One (start, end) pair for each existing booking of this room, in minutes from midnight | list of (start, end) pairs |
| returns | True if the room can be booked (AC1–AC4 all pass), otherwise False | boolean: True or False |


### 2.5 Initial assumptions and manual checks

**Assumptions:**

1. Everything happens within one day, so now is from 0 to 1439 and no booking goes past midnight.
2. The (start, end) pairs in existing can be in any order, and they don't overlap with each other.

**Checked manually:**

- On my phone I will run T1 (touching ends), T6 (start = now), 120 vs 121 minutes and a blocked room. I will also check that the page has one column, that error text is not cut off and that buttons are easy to tap.

## 3. Python v1 review

<!-- One row per conditional branch in code/original/booking_v1.py (your language's v1 on
     Path B). Quote the condition exactly. AC1-AC4 must all appear in the AC column. -->

## 5. Test cases — executed on both artifacts

<!-- Base for every case unless the row says otherwise: now = 540, blocked = False,
     existing = [(600, 660)]. Do not change the first four columns.
     Python columns: True, False or Error (it raised) — what the call actually returned.
       T11: the result of the SECOND call. T12: n/a.
       Path A: the checker runs both of your files on T1-T11 and compares (C2, C3).
     Page columns: Available, Unavailable or Not testable — what the page actually showed.
     Never write a result you did not observe. -->

| Case | Name | Input | Expected | Python v1 | Python final | Page v1 | Page final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Touching | 660–720 | Available | | | | |
| T2 | Overlap | 630–690 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T3 | Blocked | 660–720, blocked | Unavailable | | | | |
| T4 | Exactly 120 min | 720–840 | Available | | | | |
| T5 | 121 min | 720–841 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T6 | Starts now | 540–570 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T7 | Reversed | 720–660 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T8 | Ends at midnight | 1380–1440 | Available | | | | |
| T9 | Past midnight | 1380–1441 | Unavailable | | | | |
| T10 | Second booking | 720–780, existing (600–660), (700–760) | Unavailable | | | | |
| T11 | Same check twice | 660–720, twice | Available | | | | |
| T12 | Narrow screen | T1 at ~375 px wide | Available | n/a | n/a | | |

## 6. Traceability

<!-- His table. Implementation / file: where the rule lives (booking.py line, a component).
     Test input: the case IDs from section 5. v1 / final actual: what those cases gave. -->

## 7. Issue log

<!-- At least two, from v1 — a functional defect and a usability or code-quality issue where you
     have them. If every case passed on v1, log the preventive cleanup and say why.
     Reproduction names a case (T1-T12) or an AC. Priority: High, Medium or Low.
     Prompt / change: the focused prompt you sent, and what changed. Never "make it better". -->

## 8. Critique decisions

<!-- The AI's review against AC1-AC6 (stage C), claim by claim. At least three rows.
     How I verified it: the case, test or run that confirmed or refuted the claim.
     Decision: accept, reject or modify. At least one reject or modify — the reflection asks for it. -->

## 10. Reflection

<!-- 100-200 words, in your own words, no AI. Compare AI-assisted coding (the Python part) with
     vibe coding (the Bolt part); one example each of a reliability, an availability/usability and
     a security risk; why review, tool permissions and tests stay human responsibilities; one AI
     recommendation you rejected or modified, and why; what you would improve next without
     expanding the scope. -->
